    "bio": "Hi there! I am Sonny! You might also know me as PAPA React. I've been coding for over 10 years now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming developers. With this passion, I have now trained thousand's of developers across the globe. Through live coaching sessions on Youtube, I have accumulated several MILLION views demonstrating how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and challenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects to help students enter the world of web development. Youâ€™ll get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world in this community.",
